abstract = {This paper provides evidence for central bank information effects in the euro area. ECB announcements seem to convey information not only about monetary policy, but also about economic fundamentals. I separate these "information surprises" from "pure policy surprises" via sign restrictions and find intuitive effects of both surprises on a wide set of financial market prices, survey expectations and macroeconomic aggregates. Both surprise series are updated and made publicly available.}
